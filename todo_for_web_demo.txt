1.  Create a text encoder that reads your one-hot pickle dictionary
    and generates a one-hot encoded input of the proper dimensionality
    for input to the function "decode_sequence".  Should be
    (1,187,30).
2.  Run tests of this against existing data.
3.  Try creating your own cases.

IMPORTANT: Users may tend to mess up input formatting.  Be sure
that you use the "expr" capability from the textbook code to
check expression validity and kick back an exception with a message
if user input isn't valid.  But if it is valid then pass it in
to the neural network.  Be sure maximum length isn't exceed.
Remember, all kinds of people will run a web demo!
